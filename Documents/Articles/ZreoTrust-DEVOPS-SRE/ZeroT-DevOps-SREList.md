# **Zero Trust & DevOps/SRE Implementation Checklist**  

## **1. Zero Trust Implementation**  

### **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**  
✅ **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** enforced for all users and services  
✅ **Least Privilege Access** – Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Just-In-Time (JIT) access  
✅ **Continuous Authentication** – Session timeouts, behavioral analytics  
✅ **Identity Federation** – SSO integration with trusted IdPs (e.g., Okta, Azure AD)  

### **Network Security**  
✅ **Micro-Segmentation** – Network boundaries for workloads/applications  
✅ **Encryption Everywhere** – TLS/mTLS for all communications  
✅ **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)** – Replace VPNs with software-defined perimeters  
✅ **Continuous Monitoring** – Real-time threat detection (SIEM, NDR)  

### **Device & Endpoint Security**  
✅ **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR/XDR)** – Continuous monitoring  
✅ **Device Compliance Checks** – Enforce security policies before granting access  
✅ **Patch Management** – Automated updates for OS and software  

### **Data Security**  
✅ **Data Classification & Encryption** – Protect sensitive data at rest & in transit  
✅ **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** – Monitor and prevent unauthorized data exfiltration  

### **Workload & Application Security**  
✅ **Shift-Left Security** – Integrate security into CI/CD pipelines  
✅ **API Security** – Authentication, rate limiting, and anomaly detection  
✅ **Container & Kubernetes Security** – Runtime protection, image scanning

## **2. DevOps & SRE Culture Implementation**  

### **Cultural & Organizational Shifts**  
✅ **Blame-Free Postmortems** – Focus on learning, not punishment  
✅ **Cross-Functional Teams** – Dev, Ops, Security collaboration  
✅ **SLOs, SLIs, and Error Budgets** – Define and track reliability metrics  

### **Automation & CI/CD**  
✅ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Terraform, Ansible, Pulumi  
✅ **GitOps Practices** – Declarative infrastructure management  
✅ **Automated Testing** – Unit, integration, security, and chaos testing  
✅ **Continuous Deployment** – Safe rollouts with feature flags & canary releases  

### **Observability & Monitoring**  
✅ **Centralized Logging** – ELK, Loki, or similar  
✅ **Metrics & Dashboards** – Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog  
✅ **Distributed Tracing** – OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin  
✅ **Synthetic & Real-User Monitoring (RUM)** – Catch issues before users do  

### **Incident Management & Reliability**  
✅ **On-Call Rotation & Escalation Policies** – Clear ownership of incidents  
✅ **Automated Incident Response** – ChatOps, runbooks, auto-remediation  
✅ **Chaos Engineering** – Proactively test failure scenarios (Gremlin, Chaos Mesh)  

### **Security in DevOps (DevSecOps)**  
✅ **Static & Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST/DAST)**  
✅ **Dependency Scanning** – Check for vulnerabilities in OSS (Snyk, Dependabot)  
✅ **Secrets Management** – Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or similar  

---

## **3. Continuous Improvement**  
✅ **Regular Audits & Compliance Checks** – SOC2, ISO 27001, NIST  
✅ **Feedback Loops** – Retrospectives, stakeholder reviews  
✅ **Training & Upskilling** – Security & SRE best practices for teams  

---

### **Final Notes**  
- **Zero Trust** is a journey, not a one-time project—continuously validate trust.  
- **DevOps/SRE** requires cultural buy-in—focus on collaboration and automation.  
- **Measure success** through reduced MTTR, improved reliability, and fewer breaches.
