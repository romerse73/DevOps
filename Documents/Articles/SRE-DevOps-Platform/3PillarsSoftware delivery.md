The Three Pillars of Modern Software Delivery:
 A Story of Collaboration
Once upon a time, in the ever-evolving world of software, three powerful disciplines emerged—Platform Engineering, DevOps, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). Each brought unique strengths to the table, yet many misunderstood their roles, believing that one could replace the others.
A Misguided Belief

Some organizations thought:
"If we have DevOps, why do we need Platform Engineering?"
"If we have SRE, why should they work with DevOps?"

But the truth was far different. These disciplines were not rivals—they were three sides of the same prism, each reflecting a crucial aspect of delivering reliable, scalable, and cost-effective software.

The Triad of Strength
Platform Engineering laid the foundation—building the environments, managing infrastructure, and ensuring developers had the right tools to move fast.

DevOps bridged the gap between development and operations, automating pipelines, and enabling rapid, reliable deployments.

SRE stood guard over production, optimizing performance, preventing outages, and ensuring systems scaled gracefully under pressure.

Yet, their power was only unlocked when they worked together.

The Challenge of Siloed Efforts
An SRE could identify a performance bottleneck, but if developers didn’t adopt the fix in future releases, the problem would return.
A DevOps team could automate the perfect deployment pipeline, only for leadership to bypass it with manual releases from a developer’s laptop because of an emergency.

Platform Engineering could build the ideal infrastructure, but without collaboration, teams might ignore it for quick, unstable workarounds.

The Need for Mentorship & Collaboration
This was where a consultant mindset and effective mentorship came in—experts in each discipline who could guide development, testing, and leadership on why these practices mattered.
 They weren’t just enforcing rules; they were fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

SREs taught teams how to build resilient systems.
DevOps evangelized automation and repeatable processes.
Platform Engineers ensured infrastructure was scalable and efficient.

The Path Forward
The lesson is clear: No single discipline is "more important." Like a three-legged stool, removing one would cause imbalance. Success came from continuous refinement—reviewing, adapting, and improving in all three areas.
And so, the organizations that embraced this triad of collaboration thrived, delivering software faster, more reliably, and at scale—while those that siloed them struggled with inefficiency and instability.

Which of these disciplines do you think is the most misunderstood in your organization? Let’s discuss—because the real magic happens when they work as one.
