The **OWASP Top 10** is a globally recognized list of the most critical security risks to web applications, published by the **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)**. It serves as a foundational guide for developers, security professionals, and organizations to prioritize and mitigate common vulnerabilities.  

### **2021 OWASP Top 10 List** (Latest Edition)  
1. **Broken Access Control**  
   - Unauthorized users gain access to restricted data/functionality (e.g., improper permissions, IDOR flaws).  

2. **Cryptographic Failures**  
   - Weak encryption, misconfigured SSL/TLS, or exposure of sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit cards).  

3. **Injection**  
   - Code injection attacks (SQLi, NoSQLi, OS commands) due to unvalidated user input.  

4. **Insecure Design**  
   - Security flaws in application architecture or design (e.g., missing threat modeling).  

5. **Security Misconfiguration**  
   - Default settings, open cloud storage, or unnecessary features left enabled.  

6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**  
   - Using libraries/frameworks with known vulnerabilities (e.g., Log4j, Heartbleed).  

7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**  
   - Weak passwords, session hijacking, or flawed multi-factor authentication (MFA).  

8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**  
   - Compromised CI/CD pipelines or insecure deserialization (e.g., malicious code updates).  

9. **Security Logging & Monitoring Failures**  
   - Poor logging enables undetected breaches (e.g., delayed incident response).  

10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**  
    - Forcing a server to access unauthorized internal resources.

### **Why It Matters**  
- **Developers**: Build secure code by addressing these risks early.  
- **Organizations**: Comply with standards (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR) and reduce breach risks.  
- **Penetration Testers**: Focus testing on high-impact vulnerabilities.  

OWASP updates the list every 3–4 years based on real-world data. For details, visit [owasp.org](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).  


 **deeper breakdown** of the OWASP Top 10 with **real-world examples** and **mitigation strategies** for each vulnerability:

---

### **1. Broken Access Control**  
**Example**:  
- A bank’s web app lets users view other customers’ accounts by manually changing the URL (e.g., `user_id=123` → `user_id=456`).  

**Mitigation**:  
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)**.  
- Enforce server-side checks (never trust client-side inputs).  
- Use UUIDs instead of sequential IDs to prevent IDOR.  

---

### **2. Cryptographic Failures**  
**Example**:  
- Storing passwords in plaintext or with weak hashing (e.g., MD5).  

**Mitigation**:  
- Use **Argon2**, **bcrypt**, or **PBKDF2** for password hashing.  
- Enforce TLS 1.2+/HTTPS everywhere.  
- Never hardcode keys; use vaults (e.g., AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault).  

---

### **3. Injection (SQLi, NoSQLi, etc.)**  
**Example**:  
- `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1'` bypasses login.  

**Mitigation**:  
- Use **parameterized queries** (e.g., Prepared Statements in SQL).  
- Sanitize inputs with allowlists (not blocklists).  
- Adopt ORMs (e.g., Hibernate, Entity Framework).  

---

### **4. Insecure Design**  
**Example**:  
- An e-commerce app lacks fraud checks, allowing unlimited coupon reuse.  

**Mitigation**:  
- Apply **threat modeling** (e.g., STRIDE, OWASP ASVS).  
- Design with **zero-trust** principles.  
- Validate business logic flows early.  

---

### **5. Security Misconfiguration**  
**Example**:  
- An AWS S3 bucket is left public, leaking sensitive files.  

**Mitigation**:  
- Automate config checks with tools like **Chef**, **Ansible**, or **Terraform**.  
- Disable debug modes in production.  
- Scan for exposed services (e.g., Shodan, Nessus).  

---

### **6. Vulnerable Components**  
**Example**:  
- Unpatched Apache Struts leads to breaches (like Equifax 2017).  

**Mitigation**:  
- Monitor dependencies with **OWASP Dependency-Check**, **Snyk**, or **Renovate**.  
- Patch aggressively; use SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials).  

---

### **7. Authentication Failures**  
**Example**:  
- Brute-force attacks succeed due to no rate-limiting on login.  

**Mitigation**:  
- Enforce **MFA** (e.g., TOTP, WebAuthn).  
- Rate-limit logins (e.g., 5 attempts/hour).  
- Ban common passwords (e.g., `123456`).  

---

### **8. Software Integrity Failures**  
**Example**:  
- A hacked npm package (`malicious-package`) steals env variables.  

**Mitigation**:  
- Sign code/artifacts (e.g., GPG, Sigstore).  
- Verify CI/CD pipeline integrity (e.g., GitHub Actions OIDC).  

---

### **9. Insufficient Logging**  
**Example**:  
- Attackers delete logs after a breach, hiding their tracks.  

**Mitigation**:  
- Log key events (logins, admin actions) to immutable storage.  
- Use SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk, ELK) for real-time alerts.  

---

### **10. SSRF**  
**Example**:  
- Attackers abuse a webhook feature to fetch internal AWS metadata.  

**Mitigation**:  
- Blocklist internal IPs (but allowlist preferred).  
- Sanitize user-supplied URLs (e.g., reject `file://`, `169.254.169.254`).
