## Important Notes: (From Chat GTP)
Ensure that PowerShell remoting is enabled on the server.
Verify permissions to restart services on the remote server.
Always test in a safe environment before deploying in production to prevent unintended service disruptions.


## Human notes
I didn’t provide him (AI) with specific details about the company or the servers where this will run.

It’s quite effective once you understand the specific way to ask AI (Bob) for information. It’s not meant to replace human effort but rather to assist in achieving results. This applies not only to GenAI but to other tools as well.


I like this version of the script because it allows me to integrate it with other existing automation or programs.
